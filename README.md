Exploring BERT Variants and Hyperparameter Tuning for Sentence Classification on the MRPC Dataset
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for exploring BERT variants and hyperparameter tuning in the context of sentence classification using the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) dataset. The goal is to analyze how different hyperparameters and model variants affect performance and provide insights into best practices for model selection and tuning in NLP tasks.

Repository Structure
data/: Contains the dataset and data preprocessing scripts.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebook with detailed experimental setup, results, and analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
README.md: This file.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
results/: Folder containing output files and result summaries.
Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can set up the environment using the requirements.txt file.

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bert-hyperparameter-tuning.git
cd bert-hyperparameter-tuning
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC). The dataset is divided into training and validation sets with the following details:

Training Set: 3,500 sentence pairs
Validation Set: 1,700 sentence pairs
The dataset is available in the data/ directory, and preprocessing scripts are included to prepare the data for model training.

Usage
1. Data Preparation
To prepare the dataset for training, run the following script:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
This script will tokenize and format the MRPC dataset for input into the BERT model.

2. Training the Model
To train the BERT model with different hyperparameter settings, use the train_model.py script. You can specify hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs through command-line arguments.

Example:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py --learning_rate 2e-5 --batch_size 16 --num_epochs 3
3. Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
This script will generate performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. Jupyter Notebook
For an interactive exploration of the experiments and results, open the Jupyter notebook located in notebooks/. You can run the notebook with:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/bert_experiments.ipynb
Hyperparameter Tuning
The following hyperparameters were explored in this project:

Learning Rate: Tested values of 1e-5, 2e-5, and 3e-5.
Batch Size: Tested values of 8, 16, and 32.
Number of Epochs: Tested values of 2, 3, and 4.
The results and analysis of these hyperparameter settings are detailed in the Jupyter notebook and summarized in the results/ directory.

Results
The results of the experiments, including performance metrics for different hyperparameter configurations and model variants, are available in the results/ directory. The comparative analysis includes:

Accuracy of BERT-Base vs. BERT-Large
Impact of Learning Rate on model performance
Effects of Batch Size and number of epochs
