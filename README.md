This repository contains the code and resources for exploring BERT variants and hyperparameter tuning in the context of sentence classification using the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) dataset. The primary goal is to analyze how different hyperparameters and model variants affect performance and provide insights into best practices for model selection and tuning in NLP tasks.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful method for pre-training language models. It involves training a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus, such as Wikipedia. Once pre-trained, this model can be fine-tuned for specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, like question answering, making BERT highly effective for various applications.

What makes BERT stand out from previous models is its deeply bidirectional approach. Unlike earlier models, which were unidirectional or only shallowly bidirectional, BERT can fully capture the context of a word by analyzing the words both before and after it in a sentence. For instance, in the sentence "I made a bank deposit," BERT understands the word "bank" by considering the entire sentence, not just the words that come before it.

𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: In this task, 15% of the words in a sentence are masked, and BERT is trained to predict these missing words.
**Next Sentence Prediction**: This task helps BERT learn the relationships between sentences by determining whether one sentence naturally follows another.

**Pre-training and Fine-tuning**

Pre-training BERT is computationally intensive, often requiring several days on powerful hardware like Cloud TPUs. However, this is a one-time process, and the pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks with much less computational effort, often in just a few hours on a GPU.

**Versatility in NLP Tasks**
BERT’s adaptability is a major strength. It can be easily applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentence classification, sentence pair classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. BERT often achieves state-of-the-art results in these tasks with minimal task-specific modifications.

**Installation**

To run the code, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd bert-hyperparameter-tuning

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC). The dataset is divided into training and validation sets as follows:

Training Set: 3,500 sentence pairs
Validation Set: 1,700 sentence pairs
The dataset is available in the data/ directory, and preprocessing scripts are included to prepare the data for model training.

**Usage**
1. Data Preparation
To prepare the dataset for training, run the following script:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
This script will tokenize and format the MRPC dataset for input into the BERT model.

2. Training the Model
To train the BERT model with different hyperparameter settings, use the train_model.py script. You can specify hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs through command-line arguments.

Example:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py --learning_rate 2e-5 --batch_size 16 --num_epochs 3
3. Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
This script will generate performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. Jupyter Notebook
For an interactive exploration of the experiments and results, open the Jupyter notebook located in the notebooks/ directory. You can run the notebook with:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/bert_experiments.ipynb
Hyperparameter Tuning
The following hyperparameters were explored in this project:

Learning Rate: Tested values of 1e-5, 2e-5, and 3e-5.
Batch Size: Tested values of 8, 16, and 32.
Number of Epochs: Tested values of 2, 3, and 4.
The results and analysis of these hyperparameter settings are detailed in the Jupyter notebook and summarized in the results/ directory.

**Results**
The results of the experiments, including performance metrics for different hyperparameter configurations and model variants, are available in the results/ directory. The comparative analysis includes:

Accuracy of BERT-Base vs. BERT-Large

Impact of Learning Rate on model performance

Effects of Batch Size and Number of Epochs
